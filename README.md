# server

`server` helps you building a RESTful API with Java and Spring. Several modules are available:

 - [`core`](https://github.com/jrestful/server/tree/master/core): includes generic classes for services and controllers via Spring and Spring MVC, HATEOAS support over HAL, as well as CSRF protection via Spring Security, CORS parameterization, and other utilities.
 - [`seo`](https://github.com/jrestful/server/tree/master/seo): improves your SEO by generating a sitemap via JAXB and prerendering pages for bots via PhantomJS and Selenium.
 - [`mongo`](https://github.com/jrestful/server/tree/master/mongo): allows you to easily plug your application to a MongoDB database via Spring Data.
